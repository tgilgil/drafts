## Snapshot
I read the previous Stormlight Archive books and novellas. This was next in the list!

## Review
Solid fantasy with strong character development, especially for Shallan and Taravangian. The climax was a bit underwhelming, particularly compared to previous books. Overall, it feels like classic Sanderson.
